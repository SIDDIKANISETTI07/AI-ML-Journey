# 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my complete journey of learning Python, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML).

This project-based repo includes weekly learning, coding exercises, and mini-projects — everything from basic Python to advanced ML algorithms.
